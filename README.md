# Linear and Logistic Regression Analysis with Parkinson and Breast Cancer Data

## With the Parkinson data, we will do the following:
•	Make a correlation plot of the data

•	Make the performance analytics plot

•	See how motor and total UPDRS relate to one another

•	Try to predict the motor and total UPDRS scores from the other data

•	Determine which model is better
    
## With the Breast Cancer data, we will do the following:
•	Make a logistic regression model to predict the outcome (benign =2, malignant = 4) based on the measurements about the cells in question

•	Make a dominance analysis about the ten measurements in the logistic regression

This was done as an assignment using publicly available data
